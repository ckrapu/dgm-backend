# dgm-pipeline

This project streamlines the construction, training, and usage of deep generative models such as variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks and autoregressive models for Bayesian image processing tasks. `dgm-pipeline` is built around TensorFlow 2 and also makes use of `tensorflow-probability` and `tensorflow-datasets`.

I'm also using it to familiarize myself with software engineering techniques and tools such as test-driven development and continuous integration. This is definitely an instructional project. Feel free to contribute with a pull request!
